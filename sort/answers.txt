sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: The best case runtime of bubble sort is sigma(n), so sorting data already in order will be faster than Selection Sort, but slower than Merge sort.
After looking at the real time to sort sorted10000.txt and sorted50000.txt, sort1 was faster than sort3, but slower than sort2.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Compared to the other sorting algorithms, sort2 was significantly faster regardless of data size and order of the data.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Selection sort has a best-case run time of sigma(n^2), which is slower than bubble sort ( sigma(n) ) and merge sort ( O(nlogn) ).
The run time for sorted10000.txt and sorted50000.txt proved sort3 was slower than sort1 and sort2.
